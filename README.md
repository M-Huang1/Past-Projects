##Search Engine
###Michael Huang- Cynthia Zhou- Corrin- Thomas Helbowicz 
###Description
Using a google API and urllib libary, we built a search engine which looked queries that either looked for a person or a time. We used the libaries to get the page source of user inputs and after running it through a regex to locate names or dates, they are sent to the user in order of popularity.

##Blog Engine
###Michael Huang - Sophie Gershon- Justin Kim- Natan Zamansky
## Description
Using an SQL database, we built a blogging site which allowed users to post blog pages which are then added to the main page for everyone to see. The blog page also has a comment section for other users to add comments.
